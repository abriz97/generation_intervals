# Generation intervals in Rakai

Code base containing the necessary scripts to run the analysis of Generation Intervals in detected source recipient pairs.
The pairs are obtained from previous phylogenetic analyses performed by Xi \cite{}.
On the other hand, Generation Intervals are calculated making use of 2 different data sources: phylogenetic estimates of Time Since Infection were obtained through `HIV-phyloTSI`, and were refined through the demographic and testing data. 
Results of the TSI analyses can be found at: `$DEEPANALYSES/PANGEA2_RCCS_MRC_UVRI_TSI/.../...rds`.
